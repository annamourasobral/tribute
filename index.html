                <p id="depoiment-text">"Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to
                    trace
                    the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the
                    wake
                    of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of
                    artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula."
