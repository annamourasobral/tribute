                "Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is
                like trying to
                trace
                the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the
                wake
                of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of
                artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula."
